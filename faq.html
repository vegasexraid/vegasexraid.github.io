    <h3><a href="./">Back to Vegas Ex Raid Map</a></h3>

    <h2>What is an ex-raid invite?</h2>
    <p>It's a special invite so you can battle the raid boss, Mewtwo. Currently, this is the only way to get Mewtwo.</p>

    <h3>I just received an ex-raid invite, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>Congratulations, you're one of the few select people that get an opportunity to catch Mewtwo. Try to communicate with your fellow raiders prior to the event, but it's recommended to show up a little early to the raid.</p>
    
    <h3>I can't make it to an ex-raid, what can I do?</h3>
    <p>Nothing :(</p>
    
    <h3>How do I use this map?</h3>
    <p>This map shows ex-raid invites in the greater Las Vegas area starting from December 3rd, 2017 and newer. This date was selected since it was the last re-work by Niantic on the ex-raid system.</p>
    <p>Each marker on the map represents the gym name, dates of ex-raids, and how to get there.</p>

    <h3>How can I get an ex-raid invite?</h3>
    <p>No one knows for certain, but based on <a href="https://thesilphroad.com/news/ex-raid-selection-criteria-data-says-december-1st-wave/" target="_blank">a lot of research</a> you can do the following to <strong>increase your chances</strong> of getting an ex-raid invite:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Raid once per week at any of the gyms on the map</li>
        <li>Raid at sponsored gym locations such as Starbucks and Sprint stores.</li>
        <li>Pray that you'll get an invite</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I raided at the gyms listed on the map, but never got an invite.</h3>
    <p>Sorry. The ex-raid system is very much a lottery. There hasn't been a more definitive way to get an ex-raid, other than raiding at more gyms listed on the map.</p>

    <h3>Can you add all the sponsored gyms to the map?</h3>
    <p>Soon</p>

    <h3>I got an ex-raid invite, but don't see it on the map.</h3>

    <h3>What about ex-raid invites at parks?</h3>
    <p>While there are numerous parks that haven't received an ex-raid invite, there are numerous factors that could cause it to NOT issue any ex-raid invites. You can read up more about theories and research <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/7ojuoi/how_to_determine_which_gyms_are_eligible_from_ex/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>What about S2 cells?</h3>
    <p>More research needs to be spent before putting it on the map. The map is intended to be simple so you can find ex-raid possible gyms. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/7m111i/surprising_observation_of_ex_raid_gym/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Can you add Open Street Map (OSM) Tags to this map?</h3>
    <p>Maybe. More information regarding why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/7ojuoi/how_to_determine_which_gyms_are_eligible_from_ex/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
